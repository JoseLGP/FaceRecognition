# FaceRecognition

## General Description

This repo contains our work for the IPD446 course project: FaceNet-based Face Recognition System.

The project is organized in two parts:

1) Benchmarking (current status): in this step we took FaceNet pre-trained model and do a sensitivity analysis to see if the system
behaves as good as stated in the state-of-the-art original paper.
Paper link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.03832.pdf

The system works as follows:

a) Face Detection: Using the MTCNN library 
b) Face Features Extraction: Using a FaceNet pre-trained model
c) Face Recognition: using different threshold values to compare embeddings (from 0.1 to 1.0)

2) Final Algorithm (to work on it): the idea is now to improve the (VAL,FAR) rates by the use of a multi-class classifier (e.g. SVM), and to incorporate this recognition method for online recognition (e.g. web-cam).

## Our Code

Our implementation can be found in `notebooks/`. The content is:

* Experiments_no_training.ipynb: Data generation and plot for all the experiments related to non-trained models (Default v/s MaxPool no-retrain).
* Experiments_Retraining: Data generation and plot for all the experiments related to re-trained models (MaxPool+Adam v/s MaxPool+Dropout+Adam
* Sensitivity_analysis: General procedures used to get the data from the datasets (face extraction and feature extraction) and procedures to rebuild the models we used here (no-retrainable and re-trainable models).
